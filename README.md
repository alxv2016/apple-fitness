# Apple Fitness+ landing page redesign
This is an unofficial redesign of the Apple Fitness+ landing page. This project was built for education purposes following the latest modern CSS features and animation techniques produced by Apple engineers all while learning about CSS variables and Grid styles. Built from scratch with Webpack, vanilla JS and GSAP's scroll trigger to animate the scroll experience.

## Demo
You can view the demo here:
[Apple Fitness+](https://fitnessplus.alxvtoronto.com/)

## Take aways
1. Learn animations techniques used by apple to produce their scroll experience
2. Using CSS Variables and CSS Grid on a project, learn new css properties (image mask)
3. Connect a project to a headless CMS [Prismic](https://prismic.io/)
4. Dynamically injecting content from api

## Libraries used
To keep it lean only a handful of external libraries were used
1. gsap - [gsap](https://greensock.com/gsap/)
2. axios - [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)

## Dev and Build scripts
```
npm run serve
```
```
npm run build
```

All images and assets/content are properties of Apple, While modified to fit the dark theme, I do not claim ownership and this landing page demo is for educational purposes.
